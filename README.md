# Kidobotics Browser
a browser wrapping the main Kidobotics platform, it talks directly with native Os API using C# and C++ to prevent recording / capturing of browser's content.
## Build and Run
you need Visual Studio 2022 to build and run the browser yourself, after that you need to open the .sln file and hit Ctrl-F5 to start the browser.

## Preventing Recording / Screenshoting
after running the browser it will automatically open the Kidobotics platform (react app), so you can try your best to record / capture. good luck with that ✨✨
