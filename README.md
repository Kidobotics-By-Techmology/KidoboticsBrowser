# Kidobotics Browser
a browser wrapping the main Kidobotics platform, it talks directly with native Os API using C# and C++ to prevent recording / capturing of browser's content.
## Build and Run
you need Visual Studio 2022 to build and run the browser yourself, after that you need to open the .sln file and hit Ctrl-F5 to start the browser.
after running the browser you will see a white screen because you have to run the Kidobotics platform too [https://github.com/kidobotics-By-Techmology/Kidobotics-platform], the Platform will be running on localhost:3000, and thats the URL the browser is listening to by default.
running the browser again will show the kidobotics platform inside it.

## Preventing Recording / Screenshoting
after running the browser it will automatically open the Kidobotics platform (react app), so you can try your best to record / capture. good luck with that ✨✨
